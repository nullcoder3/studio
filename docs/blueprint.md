## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep crimson (#8B0000) to convey the industry's seriousness with a hint of luxury and dependability.
- Background color: Soft pink (#F5DCDC), a very desaturated tint of the primary hue, provides a gentle and professional backdrop.
- Accent color: Rich maroon (#800000), is selected to be harmonious to the primary hue while adding depth to enhance the overall feel.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif offering a neutral, modern look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Simple, clear icons to represent actions (add, edit, settings) and material types. Consistency in style for easy recognition.
- Use a responsive grid layout for coach lists on the homepage. Coach details pages should present information clearly with well-defined sections for coach information, work types, and material usage.
- Subtle transitions when navigating between pages and displaying coach details. A gentle fade-in effect can enhance the user experience without being distracting.
